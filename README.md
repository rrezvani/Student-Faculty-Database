Additional Notes: **I would like to use the 2nd of my 3 late days for this assignment.** I do not have any extra credit bonuses completed. When making a student/faculty, if its respective counterpart doesn't exist (i.e. student is made but faculty doesn't exist), then you will be immediately prompted to also complete the next person. Finally, make sure there are no additional lines at the end of "facultyTable.txt" and "studentTable.txt." Thank you!
